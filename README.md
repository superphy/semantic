# semantic   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/superphy/semantic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/superphy/semantic)
SuperPhy for the semantic web     

# Updated Quick Start

    * python run.py install - Installs the virtuall environment and nessesary packages

    * ./run.py upload -

    * ./run.py run - Compiles cofeescript & runs the flask web-server

# Quick Start

- Install Packages and download Applications
	* bash scripts/install.sh

- Compile the Coffeescript, and start the Flask Server
	* bash scripts/run.sh

## [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* Setup coffeelint to ensure we are all following the same coding style
* coffeelint.json in the root directory ensures the rules apply to all subdirectories


## [Mithril 0.2.0](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/)
The MVC framework is called Mithril, in Javascript.
It is minimalistic and can be used more like a library than a huge framework.
It is small, fast and allows easy integration with other libraries.
Like react, it provides a virtual DOM, and only re-draws what has changed.

## [LESS](http://lesscss.org/features/)
- CSS pre-processor

## [Blazegraph TripleStore](https://www.blazegraph.com/)
A standalone Blazegraph `.jar` file can be found at [Blazegraph Download](www.blazegraph.com/download/)

## Adding real genomic data to the Blazegraph triplestore
The Java Heap Size will need to be changed (probably) for datasets of our size -- even loading the basic GO owl file required this. To do so, locate the base tomcat directory. On Debian it is /usr/share/tomcat8/bin/ (there should be a startup.sh file in this directory). The catalina.sh file is the one invoked for Tomcat startup -- in it, it describes the following: create a new file in the same directory as catalina.sh called setenv.sh and specify the environment parameters in it. eg:
    export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx4g"
This will give blazegraph a 4GB heap space, which should be enough.

The OWL file for the Genomic Feature and Variation Ontology (GFVO) An ontology for describing genomic features and variants; in particular the contents of GFF3, GTF, GVF and VCF files, should be obatined from: (https://raw.github.com/BioInterchange/Ontologies/master/gfvo.xml) and installed


    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/rdf+xml' --data-binary '@gfvo.xml' http://localhost:8080/blazegraph/namespace/superphy/sparql

GO ontology for genes in OWL (http://geneontology.org/page/download-ontology). 10 tips for using GO (www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003343#s2). The latest version includes the ~900 PAMGO (http://pamgo.vbi.vt.edu/) terms for virulence


    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/rdf+xml' --data-binary '@go.owl' http://localhost:8080/blazegraph/namespace/superphy/sparql

This takes a few minutes (Modified: 1349345 Milliseconds: 926484)

The genome should undergo the quality checks before being loaded into the triplestore. Following addition, each new analysis should query the triplestore for the sequence, and then update the triplestore with the result. This allows things to be done in parallel, rather than one monolithic analysis that can fail. Also, using GET uses caching, so their shouldn't be a huge amount of data transfer (eg. querying multiple times for the same genome sequence)

## Ontology
An ontology describes hierarchical relationships, and the properties.
To create an actual RDF instance, you can use the rdf:type  -- this is so common that the agreed upon shorthand is the single letter 'a' -- it means exactly the same thing.
See (http://www.linkeddatatools.com/introducing-rdfs-owl) for a well-explained introduction using OWL and RDF.
