title Superphy Loading Pipeline Overview

'Data input
actor Curator
interface "Web Front End" as UI
database "Genbank" as GB
database "Biosample" as BS
component [Miner] as Miner
component [Upload] as Upload

GB --> Miner: "Generic meta-data JSON\ne.g. accession: { attribute: value, ... }" 
BS --> Miner
:User: --> UI
UI --> Upload

'Validation 
component [Sequence validation, part 1] as SV1

Miner .. (Ontology based metadata\nextraction from\nfree-form text)
Upload .. (Metadata from user\naccording to ontology)
Curator --> Miner : "JSON validation and\noverride rules for data source"
Miner --> SV1
Upload --> SV1
SV1 .. (Initial checks based on attributes\ne.g. length, number and\nuniqueness e.g. MD5 Checksum)

'Computation
component [Superphy queue] as SQ
component [Load metadata] as LM
component [Panseq for AMR/VF genes] as PAMR
component [Panseq for pangenome] as PPG
component [AMR/VF MSAs and trees] as AMRTree
component [Pangenome MSAs and trees] as PGTree
component [Subtyping] as ST
database "SuperphyDB" as DB
component [SNP computation] as SNP
component [R/Shiny input] as Shiny
component [Sequence validation, part 2] as SV2
component [Global genome tree] as Tree
component [In Silico typing] as IST
component [Multi-locus Variable Number Tandem-Repeat Analysis] as MLVA
component [Multi-locus Sequence Typing] as MLST
component [Serotyping] as SRT


SV1 --> SV2
SV2 --> SQ
SQ --> LM
LM --> PAMR
LM --> PPG
PAMR --> AMRTree
PPG --> PGTree
AMRTree --> ST
PGTree --> SNP
PGTree --> Shiny
SNP --> Shiny
SNP --> Tree
LM --> Shiny
LM --> IST
IST --> MLVA
IST --> MLST
IST --> SRT

SV2 .. (Secondary checks based on\ncomposition e.g. core and\naccessory fragments,\nspecies e.g. E.coli fragments)
