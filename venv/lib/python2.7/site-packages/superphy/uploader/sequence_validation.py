"""This module checks to see if a retrieved sequence is valid, by checking its base pair count, number of contigs
from sequencing, and the validity of its characters. The sequence is also ran against a reference database containing
sequences for regions that would uniquely identify it as E. coli.  As well, it is checked for uniqueness in the
database by comparing to stored md5 checksums.

Hits and validity are recorded on the SequenceMetadata object used to instantiate the validator
