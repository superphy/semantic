"""
This module converts inputted data into RDF triples in accordance with the Superphy ontology

This module uses the rdflib module to handle RDF triples in a Graph instance in preparation for conversion
into a turtle file (.ttl) or other RDF format.

The format to add triples would be:

    g.add( (subject, predicate, object) )

where each of the three terms ( can be constructed by using:

    namespace.objectname
    namespace[vars_containing_object_name]
    Literal(vars_containing_literal, datatype=XSD.typeofdata)

Examples:
    superphy = Namespace("https://github.com/superphy#")

    organism = "ecoli"
    tid = "562"

    g.add( (superphy[organism], superphy.has_taxonomy_id, Literal(tid, datatype=XSD.string) )

If you want to contruct an RDF object with many optional arguments, the Genome class is a good example.

Classes:
    NamedIndividual: superclass of all RDF Objects
    User: a Superphy user
    Organism: an organism
    Host: a host for another organism
    Microbe: a microbe
    Attribute: attributes of objects in the ontology (abstract class)
    HostCategory: host category for an object
    IsolationAttribute: details associated with isolation of a genome (abstract class)
    FromHost: the host from which the organism was extracted from
    FromSource: the biological source of the sample
    IsolationSyndrome: the syndromes associated with the sample
    Serotype: the serotype of the genome (abstract class)
    Otype: the id of the O-antigen associated with the sample
    Htype: the id of the H-antigen associated with the sample
    Genome: a genome sequenced from a sample
    PendingGenome: a genome that has not finished processing
    CompletedGenome: a genome that has finished processing
    Sequence: a DNA sequence belonging to a genome
