This folder and symbolic link are for our python modules that we create.
    
In order to import flask related python modules, this structure will put
our modules in the python folder of our virtual environment.

- Make modules, and place them in superphy/ located in the root of
the project. IE: superphy/uploader
- The symlink will point to it when we go to import the module.
