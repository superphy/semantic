"""mapper

Converts input metadata JSON input with varisous metadata type-value pairs
to URIs used in the Superphy DB

Example:
    Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
    sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
    literal blocks::

        $ python example_google.py

Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks
are also implicitly created anytime a new section starts.
