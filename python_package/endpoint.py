#Functionality:
	#Functions for interacting with SPARQL endpoint. You can query and update the Db. 
	#These should be called with SPARQL queries / updates as the data parameters, and the URI of your sparql endpoint as your URL.
	#See example functions below.
#Responsibilities:
	#The caller is responsible for sanitizing the input::These functions do NOT sanitize your input.
	#The caller is responsible for formatting the data into sparql queries
	#The caller is responsible for running a db server at the url provided.

import requests
import subprocess
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper, JSON


#Change this to change where the sparql endpoint is pointing
_url = "http://10.139.14.124:9000/blazegraph/namespace/superphy/sparql"
_ontology_file = "file:////home/drewb/Desktop/User_Login_GraphDB/ontology/User_Ontology_RDF_XML.owl"

#Takes a sparql query and a url of your sparql endpoint. 
#Returns an object containing the information you requested. -- http://rdflib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/gettingstarted.html
def query(data):
	sparql = SPARQLWrapper(_url)
	sparql.setQuery(data)
	sparql.setReturnFormat(JSON)
	results = sparql.query().convert()
	return results

def ask(data):
	results = query(data)
	return results['boolean']

#This function uses the requests library, as it was already implemented when we switched to RDFLib (SPARQLWrapper). It uses 'update' instead of query.
#Update changes the graph, and you should sanitize your input to avoid vandalism.

def update(data):
	payload = {'update': data}
	r = requests.post(_url, payload)
	return r.content

#Example data_location: "file:////home/ubiquitin/Documents/Ontologies/RDF Schemas for the Project/owl.ttl"
def file_update(data_location):
	payload = {'uri': data_location}
	r = requests.post(_url, payload)
	return r

#These are example uses of these functions.

#Note: Should printing really be in this file? Probably not

#Quick debugging print function. Takes the object returned from bgquery, and the name of all variables you want to display from your query. Unfortunatly, you have to provide the names.
